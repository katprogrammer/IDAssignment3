# Sabaibaru サバイバル
## About this project
What is **Sabaibaru サバイバル**? It is a text-based clicking web game where users have to take care of themselves in a daily setting. Players have control over their jobs, schedule as well as living conditions. Players will have to handle their statistics such as Health, Hunger and Energy. Similarly, this webpage game aims to resemble a real world setting as much as possible, allowing players to also play *Games inside a game* where they can handle game-like in-game statistics such as Health, Defense and Power.

This game aims to promote self-care as well as encourage indepency with use of APIs such as a Food API to let players know what food is good and what food is bad. The game will also make use of a Superhero API as like a form of **NPC** or **Teammate** that a player can recruit inside his game. This project will be heavily based on Javascript/JQuery and CSS instead of focusing on the HTML side of things, and making use of Lottie animations as a loading notifier, etc.

I also updated some of the code in the Javascript to reflect the division changes in the html, I shifted the menu divisions, char div and user div out of the game container so as to prevent any CSS errors when handling responsiveness.

# Commit 2.0
Completed main portion of the shop, but sadly reached a API call capacity and was unable to continue further. What's left is to do the eventlistener for the buy button in the shop and update the inventory and currency stats accordingly. Responsiveness is yet to be done, but it will be completed once the shop and inventory is completed.

For the shop, I made use of cards and also grid-styled CSS that I learned on youtube to format and design the cards. For the inventory page, I made use of new previous CSS styling such as box-shadow and transform: scale() to make look better when interacting with it.

#### General Summary:
* Completed main portion of shop page
* Completed small portion of inventory page
* JS of buying item to be done
* Responsiveness only after shop and inventory completition

# Commit 2.1
Removed Exit Game function from the game as we felt that it was pretty redundant where you can just close the web browser tab to exit. Other web browser games also do not have an exit game function but more of a save game function.

# Commit 2.2
Created a login and register form for new players. Created a database to store player log-in information and connected it to our game site.

### General Summary: 
* Created Login form
* Created Register form
* Connected restdb database to our game

# Commit 2.3
Updated the javascript with a await callback function in order to make use of the asynchronous loading. If not, data will not render properly. Fixed small portions of the log in page with proper form event listeners such as .submit() and also added a num attribute to the cards so that when a user purchases that item, it can be identitied by the id of the card and be set to the inventory accordingly.
